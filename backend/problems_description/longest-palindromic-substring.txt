💎 Problem 4: Longest Palindromic Substring
📘 Overview
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Your task is to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

❓ Problem Statement
Given a string s, return the longest contiguous substring within it that is also a palindrome. If multiple solutions exist, you may return any of them.

🧾 Constraints
1 <= s.length <= 1000

s consists of only printable ASCII characters.

🧪 Examples
Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"

Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer, as both are of equal length.

Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Explanation: "bb" is the only palindromic substring longer than one character.
