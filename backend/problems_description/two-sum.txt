➕ Problem 9: Two Sum
📘 Overview
The classic "Two Sum" problem challenges you to identify two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target value. It's often a first step into learning hashing techniques.

❓ Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume exactly one solution exists, and you may not use the same element twice.

🧾 Constraints
2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴

-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹

Exactly one valid solution exists.

🧪 Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]

Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]

Explanation:
nums[1] + nums[2] == 6
