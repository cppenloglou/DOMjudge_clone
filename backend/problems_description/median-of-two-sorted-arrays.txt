⚖️ Problem 5: Median of Two Sorted Arrays
📘 Overview
Finding the median is a common statistical task. When two sorted arrays are merged, the median is the middle value (or average of the two middle values). This problem challenges you to do this efficiently.

❓ Problem Statement
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, return the median of the combined sorted array. The algorithm should run in O(log(min(m,n))) time.

🧾 Constraints
nums1.length + nums2.length >= 1

Both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.

All elements are integers (positive, negative, or zero).

🧪 Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.0

Explanation:
Merged array = [1, 2, 3]. Median = 2

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
Output: 2.5

Explanation:
Merged = [1, 2, 3, 4]. Median = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
