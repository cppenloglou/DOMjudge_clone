## 📘 Overview
You are given a collection of intervals. Some of them may overlap. Your task is to merge overlapping intervals so that there are no conflicts in the final result.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Each interval is represented as a pair [start, end]. If two intervals overlap (i.e., the start of one is before the end of another), merge them into a single interval.

## 🧾 Constraints
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10⁴
- All intervals are valid with start <= end.

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

**Output:**  
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

**Explanation:**  
[1,3] and [2,6] overlap, so they are merged into [1,6].

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
[[1,4],[4,5]]

**Output:**  
[[1,5]]

**Explanation:**  
Even touching intervals are merged.
