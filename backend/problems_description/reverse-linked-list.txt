## 📘 Overview
Reversing a linked list is a foundational algorithm in data structures. This task involves modifying the next pointers of each node so that the list points in the opposite direction.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head.

## 🧾 Constraints
- The number of nodes is in the range [0, 5000].
- Each node’s value is an integer.

## 🧪 Examples
